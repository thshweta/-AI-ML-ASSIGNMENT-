## Use Case: Fraud Detection in Online Transactions

### Data

#### Data Sources
1. **Transaction Logs** – Records of past transactions from banking systems.
2. **User Information** – Customer profiles, account details, and historical behavior.
3. **Device and Location Data** – IP addresses, device fingerprints, and geolocation data.
4. **External Data** – Blacklists of fraudulent accounts, credit scores, and risk assessments.

#### Data Issues
1. **Missing Data** – Some transactions may lack complete details, leading to incomplete analysis.
2. **Noisy Data** – Errors in recording transaction amounts, timestamps, or locations.
3. **Imbalanced Data** – Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones, making model training challenging.
4. **Data Privacy Concerns** – Handling sensitive financial data requires compliance with regulations like GDPR.

#### Types of Data
1. **Structured Data** – Transaction IDs, timestamps, amounts (stored in relational databases).
2. **Semi-Structured Data** – JSON logs containing user-device metadata.
3. **Unstructured Data** – Emails, chat logs, or complaint texts related to fraud cases.

### Problem Statement
With the rise of online financial transactions, fraudulent activities have increased significantly. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real time is critical for preventing financial loss. The challenge is to develop a robust fraud detection system that can analyze large volumes of transaction data and identify suspicious activities with high accuracy while minimizing false positives.
